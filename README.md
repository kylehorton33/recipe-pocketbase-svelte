## :construction: To Do

### For Next Version :rocket:

- [X] avatar with color~~/thumb~~ next to title

### Unplanned :question:

- [ ] color picker
- [ ] heart for liking recipe
- [ ] different API rule depending on which field is being edited (like letting anyone "like" a recipe)
- [ ] write some tests
- [ ] input validation (zod?)
- [ ] tailwind fraction style (not as easy as applying style, need to only apply to fractions)
- [ ] tailwind lineclamp on ingredients preview
- [ ] upload image, display thumbnail
