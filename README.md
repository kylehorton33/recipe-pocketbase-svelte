# recipe-pocketbase-svelte

## :construction: To Do

### For Next Version :rocket:

- [X] ~~rich text~~ text field for recipe ingredients, instructions
- [X] use index to create a uniqueness constraint on slug and then start using that as ID
- [X] use ~~getFirst().filter()~~ getFirstListItem() in PB to find record by field. The can set slug

### Unplanned :question:

- [ ] thumbnail, color picker
- [ ] heart for liking recipe
- [ ] different API rule depending on which field is being edited (like letting anyone "like" a recipe)

## Roadmap :chart_with_upwards_trend:

- :white_check_mark: v1: register/login/logout features
- :white_check_mark: v2: 'recipes' collection, CRUD operations
- :white_check_mark: v3: expand recipe features
- :construction: v4: ?
