# recipe-pocketbase-svelte

## :construction: To Do

### For Next Version :rocket:

- [X] search bar feature

### Unplanned :question:

- [ ] heart for liking recipe
- [ ] different API rule depending on which field is being edited (like letting anyone "like" a recipe)
- [ ] input validation (zod?)
- [ ] tailwind fraction style (not as easy as applying style, need to only apply to fractions)
- [ ] tailwind lineclamp on ingredients preview
- [ ] upload image, display thumbnail
- [ ] move `/new` to a modal on `/recipes`

## Roadmap :chart_with_upwards_trend:

- :white_check_mark: v1: register/login/logout features
- :white_check_mark: v2: 'recipes' collection, CRUD operations
- :white_check_mark: v3: expand recipe features
- :white_check_mark: v3.1: update all fields in recipe, fix nav, responsive design
- :white_check_mark: v3.2: add `color` to recipes, UI tweaking, start to implement testing
